<Strong>Concept:</Strong>
Since the hackaton is for the smart city China is gonna make ... we made a model to tokenize office space ... So you have an building and instead of middle man selling space we are now building smart contracts with embedded KYC and whitelist to then create more liquid real estate market. Each project/building will have it's own ERC20 token and then each floor will have it's own ERC721 to seperate ownership etc ...
